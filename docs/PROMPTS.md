- Ok. This step is important. When working with you (claude code) in the future, I'm going to want to populate your context appropriately by having you read a file. That file should contain everything you need to be able to generate a new tool for a given purpose. It should have nothing else. It should definitely contain a list of steps to follow to check if another tool already exists, select a name and description for the tool, generate the tool appropriately (including the tools.toml file, the script, the man page) and then install the script so it immediately can be used. Again, this should be concise, yet have everything needed for a code assistant such as yourself to accomplish the task perfectly.
