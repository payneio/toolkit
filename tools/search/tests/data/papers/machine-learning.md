# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Abstract

This document provides an overview of machine learning techniques and applications.
Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques
to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Classification
   - Regression

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality Reduction

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Q-Learning
   - Policy Gradients

## Applications

Machine learning has many applications across various domains:

- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommender Systems
- Anomaly Detection
- Medical Diagnosis

## Conclusion

Machine learning continues to advance rapidly, with new techniques and applications
emerging regularly. Understanding the fundamentals is crucial for keeping up with
this rapidly evolving field.
